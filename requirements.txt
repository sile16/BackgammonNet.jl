# Python dependencies for BackgammonNet.jl
#
# These are used by test/GnubgInterface.jl for position evaluation
# and game playing against gnubg's neural network.

# GNU Backgammon Python module (REQUIRED for GnubgInterface)
# NOT available on PyPI - must be installed separately:
#   - Linux: Build from source with --enable-python flag
#     https://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/
#   - Or check if your distro has python-gnubg package
#
# Verify installation: python -c "import gnubg; print(gnubg)"

# Weights & Biases for experiment tracking (OPTIONAL)
# Only needed if using init_wandb() for logging matches
wandb>=0.15.0
